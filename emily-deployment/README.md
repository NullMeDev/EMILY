- **Surveillance Equipment Detection**: Hidden cameras, audio devices, GPS trackers, IMSI catchers
- **🤖 Autonomous Mode**: Fully autonomous threat detection and response
- **⚡ Active Exploitation**: WiFi deauth, Bluetooth attacks, RF jamming, USB HID attacks
- **🛡️ Countermeasures**: Signal jamming, IR camera disruption, privacy bubble generation
- **🔬 Evidence Collection**: Forensic-grade packet capture, spectrum analysis, system state
- **🧠 Intelligence Engine**: ML-based threat classification, behavioral analysis, pattern recognition
- **Stealth Operation**: Hidden from detection, encrypted storage, minimal footprint
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous background scanning with intelligent alerts
- **Cross-Platform**: CLI tool + Android app
- **Open Source**: Educational and research purposes

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/null/emily.git
cd EMILY

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Basic usage
python emily.py scan

# Launch autonomous mode (BETA)
python emily.py autonomous
```

### Autonomous Mode
The cutting-edge autonomous mode runs continuous threat detection and response:

```bash
# Full autonomous mode
python emily.py autonomous

# Safe mode (no exploitation/countermeasures)
python emily.py autonomous --no-exploit --no-counter

# Evidence collection only
python emily.py autonomous --no-exploit --no-counter

# Custom scan interval (default: 30s)
python emily.py autonomous --interval 60
```

### Traditional CLI Usage
```bash
# Build the CLI tool
make build

# Initialize configuration
./bin/emily config init --debug

# Perform a quick scan
./bin/emily scan --duration 30s --type full

# Start continuous monitoring
./bin/emily monitor

# List detected devices
./bin/emily list

# Show system status
./bin/emily status

# Enable stealth mode
./bin/emily stealth enable

# Real WiFi/Bluetooth scanning (requires privileges)
sudo ./bin/emily scan --duration 10s --type wifi
sudo ./bin/emily scan --duration 10s --type bluetooth
```
